# Learn how to learn

### This project was created during the second sprint of the program. In this single page website layout students were challanged to incorporate some advanced HTML and CSS capabilities like keyframes, transitions, iframes, flexbox, etc.

### The website meets the basic requirements based on the brief. After code review, plan to customize some fonts to make it stand out more.
